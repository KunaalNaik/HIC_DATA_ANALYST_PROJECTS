  - Use `AS` to assign aliases to column names, such as renaming `CustomerID` to "ID" and `CustomerName` to "Customer Name".
  - Use `SELECT` to retrieve these columns with the new names.

**SQL Code**:
```sql
%%sql
-- Task 1.1.1 - Create Order Report with Aliases
SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS "Customer Name", OrderID AS "Order Number",
