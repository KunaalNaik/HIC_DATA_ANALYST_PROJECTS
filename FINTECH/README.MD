# FINTECH Data Analyst Projects

1. **Fraud Detection in Banking Transactions**:
   - **Metric**: Fraud likelihood score.
   - **Dependent Metrics**: Transaction amount, transaction frequency, customer location, and transaction device type.
   - **Description**: Use SQL to extract transaction data and Python for analyzing transaction patterns. By calculating metrics like frequency of suspicious transactions and location-based discrepancies, you can generate a fraud likelihood score for each customer.
